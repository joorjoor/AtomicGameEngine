****** MD5 Library (common/md5.hpp) ******
md5.hpp is a reformulation of the md5.h and md5.c code from
http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/cups/cups-59/cups/md5.c to allow it to
function as a component of a header only library. This conversion was done by
Peter Thorson (webmaster@zaphoyd.com) in 2012 for the WebSocket++ project. The
changes are released under the same license as the original (listed below)
